To check version
git --version

To configure Git username and email
git config --global user.name "Ninitha"
git config --global user.email "dsfdf@gdgdfg.com"

pwd (Present working directory)
ls(to list all the files and folders of the present directory)
cd(change directory - to move to any other location)
cd c:/ninitha
mkdir [folder name] - to create new folder


to bring the code to system from github
git clone [repository link]
Make any changes..Git knows about it once u have cloned it.

git status - to check the files that are changed.

To add the file to staging
git add <filename>
git commit -m "<message>"

Now that we have made some
changes into our code, we can push
this code directly to our remote github
repository.
For this, we have to create an empty
remote Github Repository.
Create an empty remote GitHub
repository.
Note: DO NOT INCLUDE A
README.md file.

Now we need to associate the
working directory on our git bash shell
to this remote repository.
We do this using 'git remote add'
command.
git remote add <remote_name>
<remote_github_url>
You can use any name for the
<remote_name>. You need to use the
url of the github repository you just
created.


We want to push these files and
changes to our remote repository we
just created.
git push -u <remote_name>
(-u stands for username which is
promoted by this command)

You can see all the commits ever
made on this repository by typing the
command "git log"
